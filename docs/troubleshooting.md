## `offline-plugin` isn't working!

* **The ServiceWorker is not being updated.** Make sure the ServiceWorker (`sw.js`) is not being cached by the server (`Cache-Control: no-store`) and that it has a deterministic name (no hashing).
* **AppCache is being used instead of ServiceWorker.** Make sure your webapp is served with HTTPS (or localhost for development).
* **I cannot see any changes in my browser.** Make sure the browser have cached the latest resources, follow the steps outlined in the [updates](updates.md) doc.
* **ServiceWorker isn't being updated automatically.** Automatic updates isn't the default behavior, but can be achieved using the [autoUpdate option](options.md#autoupdate-true--number)
* **All routes/resources aren't being cached.** `offline-plugin` automatically caches all resources generated by webpack. Any other resource needs to be explicitly cached as [external](options.md#externals-arraystring).
* **Some pages / resources are not being served at all.** The ServiceWorker can only serve resources within its [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register). Serve your sw file from the root of your public folder, or supply the correct [`ServiceWorker.scope` option](options.md#serviceworker-object--null--false).
* **The ServiceWorker gets overridden by another app on the same domain.** Specify a unique [`ServiceWorker.cacheName`](options.md#serviceworker-object--null--false) to avoid it being overridden.
* **`offline-plugin` isn't working in dev mode.** `webpack-dev-server` compatability is unknown for the moment, so if you are using hot reloading, ServiceWorker might not work as it's supposed to.
* **cookies are not included in the ServiceWorker pre-fetch request.** Make sure you are using the correct [prefetchRequest.credentials](options.md#serviceworker-object--null--false) to allow for cookies.
* **ServiceWorker doesn't work for subpages.** `offline-plugin` is probably not conifugred to handle these routes. See the [cacheMaps](cache-maps.md) or [ServiceWorker.navigateFallbackURL](options.md#serviceworker-object--null--false) options.
* **ServiceWorker is wrongly caching api requests.** There are multiple ways to fix this depending on your setup. One way is to set [cacheMaps.requestTypes](cache-maps.md) to `['navigate']`, caching only those requests.
* **AppCache events are not worknig properly.** `AppCache.events` are known to be a bit buggy (see [updates](updates.md)). Try to avoid using them if possible.
* **Resources served from a CDN are not being cached** `offline-plugin` can cache resources served from a CDN, given the correct configuration. Make sure the resources are served with the correct headers.
* **The serviceworker is preventing redirections from taking place.** If `navigateFallbackURL` is set, it treats redirects as fails. Either set `ServiceWorker.navigateFallbackForRedirects` to `false`, or (preferred) use `cacheMaps` and remove `navigateFallbackURL`.
