# rewrites

___________________________________

This callback will iterate the `assets`, and `externals` array in service worker file generated by the plugin. This will help developers to modify assets for various scenarios such as multiple cdn domains for assets. 

```javascript

rewrites: function(asset) {	
    if (asset.endsWith('html')) {
        return 'https://www.qq.com/' + asset;
    } else {
        return 'https://s1.url.cn/' + asset;
    }

    return asset;
}
```
